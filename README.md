# Silk - a Nim HTTP server library

I'm not a fan of the state of HTTP servers in the Nim ecosystem right now, so why not try. This is currently not usable for much, but hopefully that will change in the near future.

I'm going to do my best to implement a reasonably performant HTTP 1.1 compliant server library (primarily focused a clean and easy API), and then hopefully move on to HTTP 2 when I get more acquainted, and the 1.1 implementation is decently stable and secure. It will also eventually have multi-threading support.
